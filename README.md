Setup Scripts
=============

These are the scripts I use to set up Linux servers at [work](http://www.grossmaninteractive.com) and my workstations at home. We use CentOS for servers at work, and I've been using Ubuntu for the last two years at home. I'm probably switching to Fedora, so those OSs will receive the most love at first.

TODO
====

* Fedora support.
* Gentoo support.
* Debian support.
* Arch support.

To grab these from a bare server, run the following:

`curl -Lsf https://github.com/mblair/setup_scripts/tarball/master | tar xz`
